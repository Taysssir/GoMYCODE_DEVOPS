### Data Networking Introduction

#### What is Data networking?

Learning the networking technology can help you understand the internet better. This is the media of connecting one or more persons with each other. By using internet, we can share our stories, knowledge, opinions and experiences with other people. We also can discuss interesting and hot topics with new friends by internet.

Through internet you also can broaden our minds. Well, wow, wow, we know that internet is a network of networks.
The main network types are : LAN, WAN, PAN, and MAN.
Are you confused with these network types? What do they all mean?

In this super skill, we will discuss and talk about what the exact LAN, WAN, PAN, and MAN network types are.

As seen previously, the main network types are : LAN, WAN, PAN, and MAN.

#### Personal Area Network (PAN)

PAN stands for Personal Area Network, and again, it's exactly what it sounds like: a network covering a very small area, usually a small room. The best known wireless PAN network technology is Bluetooth, and the most popular wired PAN is USB.
You might not think of your wireless headset, your printer or your smartphones as components in a network, but they are definitely talking with each other.
Many peripheral devices are actually computers in their own right. Wi-Fi also serves as a PAN technology, since Wi-Fi is also used over a small area.

#### Local Area Network (LAN)

LAN, short for Local Area Network, is a computer network covering a small geographic area with the range of 1-5 km, like the home, office, school, or a group of buildings where there are computers, servers and peripheral devices like printers, scanners, projectors and other storage components. Very often the connections between servers are carried out by Ethernet cables , and end-devices communicate with each other through wireless connection, that is, Wi-Fi. Some of the most common LAN protocols are Ethernet, Token Ring and Fiber Distributed Data Interface, or FDDI, while most of the wireless protocols in use today are 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n.

#### Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

MAN stands for Metropolitan Area Network. As MAN's name suggests, it's often used in cities and other locations covering a range of 50-60 km. MANs are high-speed connection networks that interconnect several local area networks into a single large network with a common bridge. That bridge is called backbone lines which usually established by optical fiber to boost data transfer speed. Simply put, the MAN can be considered as a group of one or more LAN networks connected together through a single cable. RS-232, X-25, Frame Relay, and ATM are the common protocol practice for communication in MAN.

#### Wide Area Network (WAN)

WAN, short for Wide Area Network, is a computer network that covers a large-scale geographical area with the diameter of roughly 100-1000 km, that is, any network whose communications link cross metropolitan, regional, or national boundaries. Devices involved are more diversified than those applied to the other types, ranging from routers to switches, firewalls modems and so on. Companies such as FS or other worldwide organizations utilize WAN connection between their various branches by communicating via microwave satellites. Some of the most common WAN protocols in use today are Frame Relay, X-25, Integrated Services Digital Network, or ISDN, and Point-to-Point Protocol, or PPP

#### LAN vs MAN vs WAN : How Do They Differ From Each Other?

With the essence of realizing communication remains the same, the three network types can differ from each other in many aspects. Some of the significant differences are listed in the chart below.

| Parameters  | LAN | MAN  | WAN  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Ownership of network  | Private  | Private or public  | Private or public  |
| Geographical area covered  | Small  | Moderate  | Very large  |
| Design and maintenance  |  Easy  | Difficult  | Difficult  |
| Bandwidth	  | Low   | Moderate  | High   |
| Data rates	  | High  | Moderate  | Low   |
| Congestion	  | Less  | More  | More   |
| Application	  | College, School, Hospital  | Small towns, City  | Country, Continent  |
